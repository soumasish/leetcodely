# Algorithmic Thinking: A Hands-on Approach to Understanding Algorithms & Data Structures 

This repo is meant to complement http://soumasish.io where I try to explain algorithms and data structures the way I understand them. Leetcode is used as a tool here for solving actual problems from each algorithmic paradigm - which opens up the repo to anyone who'd wish to work simply with leetcode without bothering about the blog - and that's fine too.

 There's a folder for languages inside of which a few problems have been added to get things going. If you wish to contribute, a big thanks, feel free to send me a PR.
